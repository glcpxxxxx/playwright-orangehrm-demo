##Your setup is now ready to run tests 🚀
**🧪 Running Tests**

###Run all tests:##
    ```bash
    pytest


### Run with visible browser window:###
    ```bash
    pytest --headed

### Run in slow motion (for debugging):###
    ```bash
    pytest --headed --slowmo 500


### Run a specific test file:###
    ```bash
    pytest tests/test_login.py


### Run with detailed output:###
    ```bash
    pytest -v


### Run tests by marker:###

    ```bash
    pytest -m login

    pytest -m regression


### Run test with multiple markers:###
    ```bash
    pytest -m "login or vacancy"

### Generate an HTML test report:###
    ```bash
    pytest --html=report.html --self-contained-html

###🏷️ Pytest Markers Configuration###

You can define markers in a pytest.ini file to organize your tests by category:

[pytest]
markers =
    login: Tests related to Login functionality
    leave: Tests related to Leave management
    claim: Tests related to Claim submission
    vacancy: Tests related to Job Vacancies
    logout: Tests related to Logout functionality

💡 Tips

✨ Always activate your virtual environment before running tests.

🐢 Use --slowmo to slow down execution for debugging.
🏷️ Use pytest -m followed by a marker name to run specific test groups.
🔁 The OrangeHRM Demo site resets periodically — data is temporary.
